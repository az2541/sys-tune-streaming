# sys-tune streaming

Allows you to play songs directly from Spotify, Apple Music, or YouTube Music using sys-tune. Start songs/playlists in the "sys-tune streaming" homebrew app, and have them keep playing outside of the app with sys-tune. After launching the app once, you will also be able to access Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music songs inside of the sys-tune overlay.

## Installation
It is highly recommended that you download sys-tune (https://github.com/HookedBehemoth/sys-tune) before installing this for additional features such as playback outside of the app. Once you have installed sys-tune, install sys-tune streaming by going to the [Releases tab](https://github.com/az2541/sys-tune-streaming/releases), downloading the latest release, and placing it on your SD card as `/switch/sys-tune-streaming.nro`. Once you have downloaded sys-tune streaming and placed it on your SD card, please open it to finalize setup and add streaming options to sys-tune.

## Support
If you encounter any issues using sys-tune streaming, please [file an issue](https://github.com/az2541/sys-tune-streaming/issues) and I will get back to you shortly.

## Building
Build the same way you build sys-tune (see [here](https://github.com/HookedBehemoth/sys-tune) for more information about that).
